# Story Quality Validation Report

Story: 1-1-repo-selection-validation-and-persistence - Repo selection, validation, and persistence  
Outcome: PASS with issues (Critical: 0, Major: 0, Minor: 1)

## Summary
- ACs present and trace to epic acceptance (3 ACs, lines 28-30).
- Tasks map to every AC with dedicated testing subtasks (lines 34-40).
- Dev Notes include architecture/prd/tech-spec citations and project structure notes (lines 44-55).
- Status/structure correct (status drafted line 3; story statement lines 7-9; change log line 65; Dev Agent Record present lines 67-81).

## Critical Issues (Blockers)
- None.

## Major Issues (Should Fix)
- None.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)
- Citations reference file paths but not specific section anchors, which could reduce auditability (e.g., context summary lines 13-18 and dev notes lines 44-48). Recommend adding section anchors in the References or inline citations. [Source: devDocs/sprint-artifacts/stories/1.1/1-1-repo-selection-validation-and-persistence.md]

## Successes
- Acceptance criteria mirror epic BDD cases with tech/arch constraints cited (lines 28-30).
- Tasks cover validation, persistence, host wiring, and testing with AC references (lines 34-40).
- Dev Notes capture constraints (repo allowlist, offline/read-only messaging, performance) and project structure placement (lines 44-55).
- Structure and metadata sections initialized (status, change log, Dev Agent Record scaffold) at expected path `/Users/arul/BMADapp/devDocs/sprint-artifacts/stories/1.1/1-1-repo-selection-validation-and-persistence.md`.
