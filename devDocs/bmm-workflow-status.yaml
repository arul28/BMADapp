user_description: |
  Building Mission Control UI for BMAD Method: take the existing Next.js app in apps/ui and ship an Electron desktop app that matches it (progress tracking, in-app terminal, BYOK chat, copy/paste prompts). Also build a VS Code extension with the same UI and features minus the built-in terminal/BYOK chat, instead leveraging Copilot-backed chat and copy/paste commands.
